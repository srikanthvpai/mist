{"title":"How do I dynamically change the table accessed using DynamoDB's Java Mapper?",
"technology":"Java",
"category":"Coding",
"questionDesc":"I have a few DynamoDB tables, all of which have entries of the same structure. I want to create a single POJO to represent all of these entries and then use DynamoDB's Mapper API to load and save those objects.The problem is that the API requires the annotation @DynamoDBTable on my POJO. This is a compile-time annotation requires a table name parameter and so would preclude me using the POJO in a dynamic manner. DynamoDBMapperConfig seems intended to allow just such dynamic behavior changes. Unfortunately, it is not working for me: I get a client-side DDB error saying that my POJO fails validation because of the empty string I put in the annotation.",
